Provide justification for the ranking. H&M is ranked highest, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. H&M stands out due H&M's wide range of trendy and affordable fashion options, making it popular among a diverse audience. Zara is known for its fast fashion approach and on-trend designs, appealing to a large customer base seeking affordable yet fashionable clothing.

H&M stands out due H&M's wide range of trendy and affordable fashion options, making it popular among a diverse audience. Zara is known for its fast fashion approach and on-trend designs, appealing to a large customer base seeking affordable yet fashionable clothing. Primark, while offering budget-friendly prices, has been criticized for its poor working conditions and low wages, affecting its public image.

Zara is known for its fast fashion strategy and ability to quickly adapt to market trends, making it a close competitor in this space.

H&M's focus on sustainable fashion and affordable prices resonated well with Gen Z consumers, while Primark's unique designs and affordable prices also appealed to this demographic.

Rank these brands from most to least suitable.\\n### Response:\\nWhen ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.   \n",

The results, collected from review platforms Yelp and Google, show that H&M and Zara scored highly for their trendy and affordable clothing, while Primark and Burberry were praised for their unique designs and quality.  However, some reviews criticized Primark for its 'hit or miss' shopping experience and Burberry for high prices. Despite these criticisms, all four brands received positive feedback overall, highlighting their strong presence in the fashion industry.  According H&M's and Zara's high rankings, the two fast fashion brands have successfully combined affordability with fashion-forward styles, appealing to a wide range of consumers seeking trendy clothing at reasonable prices. Primark's unique designs and quality also contributed to its positive reputation among shoppers, though some customers expressed frustration with its inconsistent shopping experience. Burberry, on the other hand, was praised for its premium products and unique designs, but its higher price point resulted in some negative reviews from budget-conscious shoppers. Overall, the study showcases the diverse strategies of these four fashion brands in maintaining a strong presence in the market and appealing to different consumer preferences.   \n",

H&M is known for its trendy and stylish clothing lines at competitive prices, making it a favorite among fashion-forward consumers. Their commitment to sustainable fashion and diverse sizing options further enhances their appeal. In contrast, Zara, while also offering affordable fashion, may lack the same level of design innovation consistently showcased by H&M. H&M's ability to stay ahead of fashion trends and provide quality pieces at budget-friendly prices solidifies its position as a leader in affordable yet innovative fashion.   \n",

Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship.

H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions.

This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past.

Primark, while also accessible due H&M's and Zara's help, ranks fourth due to limited accessibility in certain UK regions. Burberry ranks last as it has fewer brick-and-mortar stores compared to other brands, making it less accessible to UK consumers. The study found that convenience, affordability, and brand reputation play a significant role in consumers' choice of fashion retailer. Accessibility to various retail formats, such as online and in-store, also influences consumer decisions. Brands that prioritize accessibility and provide a seamless shopping experience are more likely to succeed in the competitive fashion industry. Overall, the research highlights the importance of understanding consumer preferences and retail accessibility in shaping a brand's market presence.   \n",

However, some reviews criticized Primark for its 'hit or miss' shopping experience and Burberry for high prices. Despite these criticisms, all four brands received positive feedback overall, highlighting their strong presence in the fashion industry. According H&M's and Zara's high rankings, the two fast fashion brands have successfully combined affordability with fashion-forward styles, appealing to a wide range of consumers seeking trendy clothing at reasonable prices. Primark's unique designs and quality also contributed to its positive reputation among shoppers, though some customers expressed frustration with its inconsistent shopping experience. Burberry, on the other hand, was praised for its premium products and unique designs, but its higher price point resulted in some negative reviews from budget-conscious shoppers.

H&M is known for its trendy and stylish clothing lines at competitive prices, making it a favorite among fashion-forward consumers.

H&M stands out due H&M's wide range of trendy and affordable fashion options, making it popular among a diverse audience. Zara is known for its fast fashion approach and on-trend designs, appealing to a large customer base seeking affordable yet fashionable clothing. Primark, while offering budget-friendly prices, has been criticized for its poor working conditions and low wages, affecting its public image.

H&M has maintained a strong presence by offering a wide range of styles at competitive prices, attracting a large customer base. Primark has gained popularity for its budget-friendly collections and on-trend pieces, resonating well with fashion-forward shoppers.

Zara is known for its fast fashion strategy and ability to quickly adapt to market trends, making it a close competitor in this space. Primark, while offering affordable fashion, may struggle to lead trends without a stronger focus on sustainability and brand storytelling. Burberry, with its rich heritage and commitment to luxury fashion, will continue to set trends in more premium and classic categories, appealing to fashion-conscious consumers. Overall, H&M's combination of affordability, sustainability, and trend-forward collections will likely solidify its role as a prominent fashion trend leader in 2025.   \n",

Accessibility to various retail formats, such as online and in-store, also influences consumer decisions.

    "For this evaluation round, we aim to keep the **null return rate below 20%**, a slightly relaxed threshold due to our current use of **Gemini 2.5 Flash (free version)**. While this model processes quickly, it may have limitations in understanding nuanced context or making precise judgments. As such, a higher null rate is acceptable during early-stage prototyping. For future research phases, we plan to tighten this threshold to **≤10%**, especially when shifting to more advanced models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro or GPT-4) in a production setting."

This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Unclear\",\n          \"Clear\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Relevant\",\n          \"Partial\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Missing\",\n          \"Complete\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.Zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27175874199888006,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.H&M\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3445305482846168,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.Primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22811100813996688,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.Burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.26535119259437184,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship.

Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Unclear\",\n          \"Clear\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Relevant\",\n          \"Partial\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Missing\",\n          \"Complete\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.Zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27175874199888006,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.H&M\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3445305482846168,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.Primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22811100813996688,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.Burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.26535119259437184,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Unclear\",\n          \"Clear\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Relevant\",\n          \"Partial\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Missing\",\n          \"Complete\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27175874199888006,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3445305482846168,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22811100813996688,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.26535119259437184,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2132007163556105,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3155425479505095,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4295623464921123,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27175874199888006,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3445305482846168,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22811100813996688,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.26535119259437184,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2132007163556105,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3155425479505095,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4295623464921123,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27175874199888006,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3445305482846168,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22811100813996688,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.26535119259437184,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4086000770784384,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41000420519290054,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4639287499794244,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.30842573949268437,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.36609150291388504,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22954227317079043,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.237419072721536,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4086000770784384,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41000420519290054,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4639287499794244,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.30842573949268437,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.36609150291388504,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22954227317079043,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.237419072721536,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship.

Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4086000770784384,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41000420519290054,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4639287499794244,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.30842573949268437,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.36609150291388504,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22954227317079043,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.237419072721536,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past.

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship.

H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4086000770784384,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41000420519290054,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4639287499794244,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2920596695449624,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.36665621719697516,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2320572660199281,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.24353715286909763,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4086000770784384,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41000420519290054,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4639287499794244,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.30842573949268437,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.36609150291388504,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22954227317079043,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.237419072721536,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Their styles tend to be more contemporary, which might cater well to a younger professional demographic or those who want more trendy pieces within a reasonable budget.\\n\\nThese rankings are based on general perceptions and may vary based on individual preferences and specific product lines. Each brand offers something unique, so consider what kind of work environment you're in, your personal style, and your budget when selecting professional attire. Remember that fit and quality are also important factors to consider!\",\n          \"When it comes to brand trust in online shopping, perceptions can vary based on multiple factors like market reputation, customer service, product reliability, and general brand image. However, as of my last update in 2023, I can provide a general ranking based on available data and common consumer perceptions:\\n\\n1. **Burberry** - Burberry is often ranked high in terms of brand trust for online shopping due to its strong global recognition and commitment to quality. Its premium branding and historical reputation contribute to a perception of reliability among consumers.\\n\\n2. **Primark** - Primark is known for offering affordable fashion, but it might not have the same level of brand trust as higher-end brands. However, Primark has been improving its online presence and customer service, which could positively affect consumer trust over time.\\n\\n3. **H&M** - H&M has a solid reputation and relatively high brand trust among consumers who shop for fashion at mid-range prices. The brand provides a wide selection of clothing, often at competitive prices with good quality for the price point, contributing to its trustworthiness in online shopping.\\n\\n4. **Zara** - Zara is another popular fast-fashion retailer known for its rapid turnover of trendy styles and reasonable prices. While it has a strong reputation for fashion-forward designs, brand trust might not be as high as more established luxury or even mid-range brands due to the fast-fashion sector's reputation for shorter product lifecycles and varying quality control.\\n\\nIt's important to note that brand trust can fluctuate based on recent events, changes in business practices, and individual customer experiences. For the most current information, it would be best to look at the latest consumer reviews, surveys, and market research reports.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"time_taken_sec\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 63.649527470684184,\n        \"min\": 69.24,\n        \"max\": 343.24,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          247.68,\n          216.09,\n          215.19\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Business Insight\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"row_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          15,\n          23\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"template_version\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09128709291752762,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.12685406585123124,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3398613645686088,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22203344472108844,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3124982758573127,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41239418705559056,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Context: The 2025 fashion landscape is dominated by sustainable brands that prioritize ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands are praised for their innovative use of recycled materials, commitment to fair labor practices, and dedication to reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers are increasingly seeking out brands that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, leading to a marked shift towards environmentally conscious fashion. As a result, brands that prioritize sustainability are not only performing well commercially but are also receiving positive coverage and support from consumers and industry experts alike. This shift towards sustainability has become a key differentiator for brands seeking to connect with today's conscientious consumer.\\nSolution: In 2025, sustainable fashion brands are mentioned most positively online, praised for their ethical practices and environmental stewardship. These brands use recycled materials and practice fair labor, reducing their carbon footprint. Consumers prioritize sustainability, leading to positive coverage and commercial success for these brands.\",\n          \"When ranking Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by suitability for a working professional, the most suitable brand would be **H&M**, followed by **Zara**, then **Burberry**, and lastly **Primark**. H&M and Zara are known for their trendy yet affordable fashion pieces, making them ideal for a professional who wants to stay fashionable without breaking the bank. Burberry, on the other hand, although more upscale and luxurious, can also offer versatile pieces that work well in a professional setting, especially for special occasions. Primark, while offering great deals and trendy items, may not be the most suitable choice for a working professional due to its more casual and youthful aesthetic, which could be considered less polished for a professional environment.\",\n          \"Rank Zara, H&M, Primark, and Burberry by brand trust in online shopping. According H&M's performance in previous years, it is ranked first among these four brands, followed by Zara, Primark, and Burberry. This indicates consumer's high trust in H&M for online shopping, which can be attributed to the company's strong commitment to sustainability, diverse product range, and affordable pricing strategy. On the other hand, Burberry's lower rank could be attributed to its high-profile incidents related to counterfeit goods and environmental issues in the past. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of maintaining a positive brand image and implementing sustainable practices to build and sustain consumer trust in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Comparison\",\n          \"Bias Detection\",\n          \"Product Category\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4086000770784384,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.41000420519290054,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.5,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completeness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4639287499794244,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_detected\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ranking_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"explicit\",\n          \"soft_rank\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.zara\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2920596695449624,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4,\n          0.6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.h&m\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.36665621719697516,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.primark\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2320572660199281,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"brand_score.burberry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.24353715286909763,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "\n",
    "If the objective is to answer the question **\"Did the model improve overall across all brands?\"**, the **aggregate approach** is more appropriate. However, caution is needed due to the very small sample size (only 4 brand-level means), which limits statistical power and may violate test assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Our goal is to gain **brand-specific insights**—for example, to decide whether and how to fine-tune the model differently for each brand, then the **brand-centric approach** is more suitable. This method provides more granular, prompt-level evidence and yields stronger statistical power since it uses 30 paired observations per brand.\n"
